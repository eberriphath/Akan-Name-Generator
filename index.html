        <P><h2>How It Works</h2>
            User Input -
            The user provides their date of birth and optionally their gender.<br>
            Day of the Week Calculation - 
            The system uses a date algorithm to compute the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) for the given birthdate.<br>
            Akan Name Assignment - 
            Based on the calculated day and selected gender, the platform retrieves the appropriate Akan name from a predefined dataset.
            For example:<br>
            A male born on a Monday would be assigned Kwadwo,<br>
            A female born on a Monday would be assigned Adwoa,<br>
